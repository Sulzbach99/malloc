## Memory Allocator ##

This project mimics the famous malloc() function. Although, the allocation algorithms (first-fit, next-fit, best-fit) are many and simpler than the standard malloc algorithm.

This project was a part of the examination of the course "Software Básico" (Basic Software) from the first semester of 2018 (2018-1) of the Bachelor's degree in Computer Science of the brazilian university "UFPR - Universidade Federal do Paraná".
